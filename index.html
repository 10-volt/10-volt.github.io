   <p>Greetings! <br> I'm 10-volt! you may have seen me around in a few places, notably on mariokart, nintendo modding or linux related discord servers, or on the fediverse. I'm on a few other places but I'm not very active on those places so it's unlikely you would have found me there. <br> I'm an australian nurodivergent bi-ace dude and I enjoy technology and learning things about it (making this website is a learning project) I also enjoy playing video games (like most people) <br> here are some dot points about me:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Please tell me if I'm being rude, I can't tell sometimes and I very rarely intend to be</li>
    <li>Please do not flirt with me</li>
    <li>asexual (absolutely) and bisexual (Theoretically, subject to change)</li>
    <li>My Username is based on 9-volt from the warioware games</li>
    <li>I enjoy various video games, Undertale being my favourote game of all time, celeste being a close second</li>
    <li>I usually have trouble paying attention to things, if you've ever chatted to my irl you'd know that</li>
   </ul>
