<h2>my personal website, it’s a bit empty for now but it will get better in time</h2>
<h3>If you are some random I have no idea how you got here but as long as you aren’t creepy I welcome you :D</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m 10-volt, I’m some dude who somehow ended up on the internet (probably by mistake)</p>
<p>I like technology a lot and I like to play with silly projects that come to my mind with the stuff I already have, I’m gonna try to learn programing soon (probably html and CSS so I can make this website nicer) I’d love to learn other languages too as I’d love to make projects and
tools that maybe could come in handy for one or two people :3</p>
<p>On the internet I try to be kind and polite to everyone I talk to and I think I do a decent job most of the time, but unfortunately sometimes I do stupid things and I say or do things I later regret, if I ever act rude or mean to you I deeply appologise, please let me know when I act out &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a new PFP on my <a href="https://10-volt.github.io/accounts">public accounts</a>, It’s a basic self portrait I made in <a href="https://gimp.org">GIMP</a>, with the white ass me wearing a hoodie I like (I don’t even wear that hoodie that much anyway as it’s always hot af but I really like it) I always go back and fourth between thinking that PFP is great and thinking it’s cringe and I shouldn’t use it or I copied other people (even thought it’s common for people to make self portraits their PFP) or that it’s too lazy or childish, even though most people really don’t care about some internet rando’s PFP</p>
<p>I think that’s about what I wanted to say rn, it was really nice to just be able to write about this and if your reading this have a wonderful day &lt;3</p>
