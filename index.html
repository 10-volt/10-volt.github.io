<p>Hello, I’m 10-volt, I’m some dude who somehow ended up on the internet (probably by mistake)
I like technology a lot and I like to play with silly projects that come to my mind with the stuff I already have, I’m gonna try to learn programing soon (probably html and CSS so I can make this website nicer) I’d love to learn other languages too as I’d love to make projects and tools that maybe could come in handy for one or two people :3</p>
